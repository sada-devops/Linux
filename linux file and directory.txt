Every file and directory has three levels of ownership
    user, group, others
    multiple levels of access > read, write, execute/access
    three types of privilages > owner, group, others(world)

selinux, apparmor - security tools in linux for strong security access

Every file has 6 permission mode > read, write, execute, stickybit, setuid, setgid.

stat --format=%a:%A:%U:%G /etc (to check the permissions of a directory/file)

mkdir > to create a directory
    mkdir -p directory/subdirectory (to create a directory and a subdirectory)
    mkdir directory/subdirectory (to create a subdirectory in an existing directory)
    mkdir -m 0700 directory (create a directory with user only permission)

r w x = rwx
4 2 1 =     (default values)
      = 0400 (read only)
    stickybit 1400
    setgid 2400
    setuid 4400

touch > to create a file
    touch file{01..100}test.doc (to create files from 01 to 100 in batch)

tree > list files/directory in hirearchy

relative and obsolute file paths
    cd / (obsolute file paths from here) /etc
    relative filepath are one with in a directory /home/user/Downloads

remove files/directory
    rm filename
    rm -v filename (verbose-shows notification)
    rm -iv filename (prompt for confirmation)
    rm -rf (recursive forced)

cp (copy)
    cp -rv (recursive verbose)

mv (rename)
    mv -v filename newfilename

chmod (file permissions)
    chmod -v 0600 filename (octal notation)
    chmod -v g+w,o+w filename (symbolic notation)
    chmod -v u-w filename (removes write perms for user)
    chmod -v 0400 filename* (change all files perms in a given directory)
    chmod -v 0400 filename filename2 filename3 (multiple files at a time)

chown (file ownership)
    chown -v username:usergroup filename

umask (default file permissions)
    umask -S (shows permissions for U, G, O)
    vi /etc/login.defs (to change umask never recommended)

ln > links (to create shortcuts/links to files/directory)
    softlink - for files/directory
    hardlink - only for files
    ln -s /home/user/filename newfilename
    ln -hl /home/user/filename newfilename (hardlink data is intact in one of the files when removed, use as a backup)

special modes (setuid, setgid, stickybit)
    stickybit - applies to directory with files owned by multiple users, restricts move,delete
    chmod -v 1770
    setgid > chmod 2770 - applies the owner group permissions to all the files
